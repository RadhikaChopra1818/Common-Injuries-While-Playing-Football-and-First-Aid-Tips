1. Ankle Sprains
Cause: Ankle sprains are among the most common injuries in football, occurring due to sudden twists or awkward landings. Overstretching or tearing of ligaments in the ankle is the typical mechanism of injury.
Symptoms:
    • Pain, swelling, and bruising around the ankle.
    • Difficulty walking or bearing weight.
First Aid:
    • Rest: Stop all activity and keep the injured ankle immobile.
    • Ice: Apply an ice pack wrapped in a cloth for 15–20 minutes to reduce swelling.
    • Compression: Use an elastic bandage to wrap the ankle, ensuring it’s snug but not too tight.
    • Elevation: Raise the ankle above heart level to minimize swelling.

2. Knee Injuries (ACL Tears, Strains, and Patellar Dislocations)
Cause: Quick pivots, sudden stops, or high-impact tackles often result in knee injuries, including anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears, muscle strains, or dislocations.
Symptoms:
    • Severe pain and swelling.
    • Instability or inability to straighten the knee.
First Aid:
    • Rest: Avoid putting any weight on the injured leg.
    • Ice: Apply a cold pack to the knee to reduce swelling and numb pain.

    • Seek Medical Attention: For severe cases like ligament tears, consult an orthopedic specialist promptly.

3. Shoulder Injuries (Dislocations, Sprains, and Rotator Cuff Tears)
Cause: Falls, tackles, or overextending the arm during a pass can lead to shoulder injuries. Dislocations and rotator cuff tears are common, causing intense pain and limited mobility.
Symptoms:
    • Sharp pain and swelling around the shoulder joint.
    • Deformity or inability to move the shoulder.
First Aid:
    • Immobilization: Use a sling or cloth to stabilize the arm in its current position.

Symptoms:
    • Stiffness, pain, and limited range of motion.
    • Swelling or tenderness around the neck area.
First Aid:
    • Immobilize: Keep the neck in a neutral position to avoid further strain.
    • Pain Relief: Use a neck pain relief spray to reduce muscle stiffness and soreness.
    • Ice Pack: Apply an ice pack for 15 minutes to control swelling.
    • Medical Attention: If numbness, tingling, or severe pain occurs, seek immediate medical care.

5. Muscle Strains (Hamstring, Quadriceps, and Calf Muscles)
Cause: Overuse, fatigue, or sudden stretching of muscles during sprints or tackles can result in strains.
Symptoms:
    • Sudden pain and tenderness in the affected muscle.
    • Swelling and difficulty in movement.
First Aid:
    • Rest: Stop playing and rest the strained muscle.
    • Ice: Apply an ice pack to reduce swelling and pain.

Cause: Collisions, falls, or being hit by the ball can lead to head injuries, including concussions.
Symptoms:
    • Dizziness, nausea, or confusion.
    • Loss of balance or consciousness.
First Aid:
    • Rest: Lie the player down in a comfortable position.
    • Monitor: Check for symptoms like worsening confusion or drowsiness.
    • Avoid Medications: Do not administer medications unless directed by a doctor.
    • Immediate Medical Care: For severe symptoms, seek emergency care immediately.

7. Cuts and Bruises
